The code of my C programming contest. First prize.

I am sorry about the language since I haven't translate it from Chinese to English yet.

The file matrix_calculator.c is the code of the matrix calculator. Run the code and follow the instruction and you will get the result. This program was developed when I was a freshman and just touched the C programming, so the code has a lot of touble but it did help me to win the first prize since its completed function.

The file hill-cypher_decoder.c is the code of the Hill-cypher decoder. You are supposed to have the encrypted message and the key before running the program. Then this program will instruct you to work out the message.
